# Musing
<p align="center">  

Musing is a Full-featured "Meditation application" which is in progress as I am working on the same.
I have included different functionalities such as Splashscreen, UserprofileScreen, login, Signup, Firebase Google Signup, onboarding screen, Fragments and many more.
I have used three fragments for different purpose as i have included favourite fragments for a favourite meditation session and Music fragments for soothing and calming music sessions.

I have used handler class with seek bar implementation to play meditation audios.
For user authentication and to save data I have used Firebase as a backend.

I am working on the current version of application so that i can publish application on playstore as soon as possible.
